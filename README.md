# Hiring_Management_System
An online portal where user can assign candidate applied for a job to  interviewer according to some algorithm

The project aims to build a web Portal for user to login and select the candidates who applied for different job roles and 
select the candidate according to their year of experience and skills and match them to the interviewer according to the above fields. 
After the interview is over, the candidate will be given a feedback , and their updated status will be, whether they are being selected or rejected.

We used React JS for the front-end UI design and MySQL ,
Spring Rest API for the back-end site in this project.
- The company EY is hiring and is inviting candidates with relevant skillset with applied jobs in our Hiring portal.
- Candidates are allowed to visit the portal, look for their matching job description and the portal has features to allow the candidates to apply for the job by uploading their resume.
- We have designed an internal portal which can be operated by admins, the portal has capabilities to read different candidate profiles and load to internal system for further hiring process.
- A new user will have provision to register himself/herself to the portal before logging in. An existing user can directly login onto the portal.
- An admin has a home screen where job description of all the vacancies is listed down for which the portal is hiring.
- Upon selecting each job description the application list down all the candidates who have applied for that particular job.
- It is assumed that admin will review each of these profiles and proceed with scheduling an interview if the skillset matches the job description. The admin will make a phone call to the candidate to collect more information before scheduling the interviewer for interview.
- After the interview is completed it is assumed that the interviewer will contact the admin and give feedback.
- The admin will login again on the portal and update the status of the candidate as Selected/Rejected/Pending as per interviewer feedback.
